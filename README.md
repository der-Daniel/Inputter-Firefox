Why do I need this?

Most popular websites, like YouTube or Amazon, have a big, bold search bar at the top of their website. When you do a search and scroll trough the results, the website will lose focus on the search bar as you click or select something on the page.
If you want to change the query, you usually need to scroll all the way up and click the search bar again. There are some websites like Google Search that provide an auto-focus when you start typing. But many websites does not ship with a convenient way to quickly change the query.

Inputter provides a unified shortcut to focus the search bar with Crtl+Shift+L.

Notice that Inputter is purposely dumb:
It crawls the website and looks for the first reasonable input text field. This approach holds for many websites like: YouTube, Google, Amazon, Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Facebook, dict, Linguee and many more.
